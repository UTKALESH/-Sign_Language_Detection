#  Sign Language Detection System

> **Detect. Recognize. Communicate.**

---

## üìú Project Description
This project develops a machine learning model that **detects sign language gestures** and **recognizes selected words**.  
The system is active **only between 6 PM and 10 PM**, simulating a real-world usage schedule.

A full **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** provides two modes:
- **Upload Image** for sign detection from pictures.
- **Real-Time Video Detection** via webcam.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
-  **Trained CNN Model** for sign recognition.
-  **Time-limited operation** (active from 6 PM to 10 PM only).
-  **Image Upload** support for gesture detection.
-  **Real-time Detection** through webcam.
-  **Performance Visualization** with confusion matrix and accuracy reports.
